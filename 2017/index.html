<p>After the completion of this class you will have developed the skills to model,
interpret, simulate, and analyze <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multibody_system">multibody systems</a>, i.e. systems which are
made up of interconnected rigid bodies with arbitrary constraints and applied
loads. Mathematical models of multibody systems are typically very useful at
predicting the motion of macro scale objects. <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion">Newton's laws of motion</a> are
the foundation of developing predictive models of these systems.  Examples of
systems you will be able to model are: spacecraft trajectories, human/animal
biomechanics, vehicle motion, robot motion, etc.</p>

<h2>Academic Integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-integrity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html">Academic Integrity
web page</a> from UC Davis Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the
campus' policy on academic responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis

<div class="section" id="course-text-and-materials">
<h2>Course Text and Materials<a class="headerlink" href="#course-text-and-materials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The majority of preparation and readings for the lectures will come from this
textbook:</p>
<blockquote>
Thomas R. Kane, and David A. Levinson. Dynamics, Theory and Application.
McGraw Hill, 1985. <a class="reference external" href="http://hdl.handle.net/1813/638">http://hdl.handle.net/1813/638</a>.</blockquote>
<p>Note that the book is out of print, but you can download a PDF copy from
Cornell's eCommons digital repository for personal use. Additionally, the
following book may also be a useful reference for some topics:</p>
<blockquote>
Thomas R. Kane, Peter W. Likins, and David A. Levinson. Spacecraft Dynamics.
McGraw Hill, 1983. <a class="reference external" href="http://hdl.handle.net/1813/637">http://hdl.handle.net/1813/637</a>.</blockquote>
<p>There are many advanced dynamics books that provide useful information but
these two present the material in the context and notation that we will use in
class. Other useful references will be added to the resources tab of this
website as we move through the course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software">
<h2>Software<a class="headerlink" href="#software" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will be making extensive use of <a class="reference external" href="http://pydy.org">PyDy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://sympy.org">SymPy</a> to model and simulate
multibody systems. These packages are written in the open source Python
programming language and leverage the SciPy ecosystem of scientific and
engineering computing tools. You will have access to these through our
JupyterHub server at <a class="reference external" href="https://bicycle.ucdavis.edu">bicycle.ucdavis.edu</a>. You may also install the software on
your own computer. You will need to bring your laptop, tablet, or phone to
class to follow along with the interactive sessions. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/mae223/pages/software.html">software page</a>
on this website for more information.</p>

<div class="section" id="assignments-grades">
<h2>Assignments &amp; Grades<a class="headerlink" href="#assignments-grades" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Being a graduate class, we will not be focused on grading many different
detailed aspects of the class. You will be expected to do as much or little
practice as needed to pass the exams and complete your project. Homework
problems will be suggested but not graded. I recommend talking through homework
solutions with your classmates and me during office hours.</p>
<p>Grades will be available in the <a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">canvas.ucdavis.edu</a> grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics.</p>

<dt>Exams</dt>
<dd>Two take home exams will be given. These must be completed individually. You
can use any materials you want but you are on your honor to not discuss the
exams questions with any other person other than the instructor.</dd>
<dt>Project</dt>
<dd>You will be expected to complete a modeling, simulation, and analysis
project that you design on your own. You are encouraged to discuss this
project with others, but you must do all of the work and presentation
yourself. You will give a short lightning presentation on the results to the
class during the final exam time.</dd>

<div class="section" id="canvas">
<h2>Canvas<a class="headerlink" href="#canvas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will make use of Canvas for the course. Log in to <a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">canvas.ucdavis.edu</a> with
your Kerberos ID and passphrase then select <strong>MAE 223 001 FQ 2017</strong>.</p>
<p>We will be using several features in Canvas:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Announcements</dt>
<dd>This will be my primary communication avenue to you. These announcements
will be forwarded automatically to your UCD email address. You are expected
to read these either through your email program or on the Canvas website.</dd>
<dt>Assignments</dt>
<dd>Any assignments will be distributed here and collected here.</dd>
<dt>Grades</dt>
<dd>Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
as the course goes along.</dd>
<dt>Files</dt>
<dd>Copyrighted and private files, documents, and other resources will be
available here for download. The rest will be available for download on this

<div class="section" id="communication">
<h2>Communication<a class="headerlink" href="#communication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This class requires a lot of communication: among your team, with your
sponsors, with your mentors, and with the instructors. This can quickly get
unmanageable, especially for the instructors' email inboxes. So here are some
simple rules to follow with respect to communication:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><a class="reference external" href="http://piazza.com/ucdavis/fall2017/mae223">Piazza</a></dt>
<dd>This is the first place to ask questions. Use this forum to ask questions
that are general for the class. Try to restructure your less general
questions into general ones so you can ask here. This minimizes the number
of times a question has to be answered and allows both students and
instructors to collectively answer questions. Note that there is a single
instructor answer and a single student(s) answer. Your contributions to
answering questions on Piazza will be used to boost your grade on borderline
cases.</dd>
<dt>Email</dt>
<dd>Use email for individualized communication, i.e. for questions about project
specifics or other personal needs. Prepend &quot;[MAE223]&quot; to their subject line.</dd>
<dt>Office Hours</dt>
<dd>Please come visit me in office hours to discuss your work. The earlier, the
better.</dd>
<dt>Appointments</dt>
<dd>You may schedule an appointment with me outside of office hours if all of
the above doesn't work for some reason. Use this as a last resort.</dd>
